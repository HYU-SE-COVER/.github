> Harnessing Matter to Integrate Legacy Devices into the Next-Gen Smart Home Ecosystem

## Introduction

The global smart home market, expected to exceed $164 billion by 2028, is experiencing significant growth, driven by demands for convenience, security, and energy efficiency, and witnessing advanced device integrations. However, the proliferation of various smart devices from multiple brands has fragmented user experiences, creating a complex web of control applications. This fragmentation, evident in platforms like Apple Home and Google Home App, and the lack of IoT integration in numerous devices, poses challenges. To bridge this gap, the LG Cover is introduced, offering a unified solution that ensures a consistent user experience across different brands and ages of devices. LG Cover supports the integration of Matter and ThinQ devices, revitalizing older IR technology devices, and enables communication with non-Matter-supporting devices through the Matter API, providing a seamless, comprehensive smart home ecosystem.
